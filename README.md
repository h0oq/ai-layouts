I made an experiment today, and it failed miserably.

I realized my prompts were inaccurate and my goal probably unrealistic, especially on free plans.

Even if I'm not a front-end dev, I've some background with these configurations.

I would be very hard for a complete beginner to detect and fix all glitches that happened during this test.

In that perspective, the rant is clearly right: overcomplicated structures that kinda obfuscate nasty bugs, wrong advices for a11y, etc.

However, I really do think it was simply not the right platform and the right prompts.

Next test will include local agents, riched context, and a real plan.
